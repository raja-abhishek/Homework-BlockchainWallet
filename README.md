# Homework-BlockchainWallet

#### Background

Build a new and disruptive platform called Fintech Finder. Fintech Finder is an application that its customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them. As Fintech Finderâ€™s lead developer, the task is to integrate the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency.

#### Structure:

Used two Python files structure for creating the platform.

The first file is called fintech_finder.py. It contains the code associated with the web interface of application. The code included in this file is compatible with the Streamlit library. 

The second file is called crypto_wallet.py. This file contains the Ethereum transaction functions. Used import statements to integrate the crypto_wallet.py Python script into the Fintech Finder interface program that is found in the fintech_finder.py file.

Integrating these two files allow to automate the tasks associated with generating a digital wallet, accessing Ethereum account balances, and signing and sending transactions via a personal Ethereum blockchain called Ganache.
